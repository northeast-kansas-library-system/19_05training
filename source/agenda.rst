Koha Upgrade Training Overview
===============================

Next Search Catalog will upgrade to Koha 19.05 on the evening of Saturday, January 4, 2020.

The upgrade will start sometime after all libraries have closed for the day and be finished before any of the libraries reopen on Sunday morning.  In the past this process has started around 9:30 p.m. and has finished before midnight.

NEKLS staff will run tests on Sunday morning and phone each open library on Sunday January 5 to make sure there are no unexpected problems.

The rest of this website will cover most of the changes that will be added by this upgrade.
