Cities and towns
----------------


Currently Koha allows you to select a city/state/zip code combination from a drop-down list when adding a patron's address.  Some libraries use "Alternate address" and "Alternate contact" which both have address fields, but do not have a drop-down for a city/state/zip code combination.

After the upgrade, the drop-down for city/state/zip code combinations will be added to those addresses.
