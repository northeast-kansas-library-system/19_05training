Ability to calculate how much change to give a patron

Work is being done in the Koha community to add features to the software that would allow libraries using integrated cash registers to connect those cash registers directly to Koha.  Some of these features will be noticeable to us even though many of our libraries don't even have cash registers.  This includes a new change calculator and the "Payment type" drop-down that was added in our last upgrade.

This is what these changes will look like to us:
