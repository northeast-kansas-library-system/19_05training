Searching - availability display
----------------------------------

In the search results page, Koha used to describe items as:

| Available
| On loan

Items that were in transit from one library to another or that were on the hold shelf waiting to be picked up were listed as "Available."

Items are now described as:

| Available
| On loan
| Unavailable

Any items that are waiting on the hold shelf to be picked up or are in transit from one library to another or are lost or missing will be described as "Unavailable."

*Unfortunately we cannot display a "Before" and "After" picture of this change because the change has already been back-ported to our production system.*
