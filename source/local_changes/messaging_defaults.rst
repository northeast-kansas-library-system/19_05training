Patron messaging preferences defaults
-------------------------------------

Since time immemorial, Next Search Catalog has had the default settings for a patron's messaging preferences only set to automatically send patrons a notification when requests arrive and are ready to be picked up.

Beginning with the upgrade on January 4, 2020, all new patrons will have their default messaging preferences set to send them the following messages via e-mail:

* Item due: Email digest
* Advanced notice: 3 days, Email digest
* Hold filled: Email
* Email check-out/renewal receipt: Email

The table in the Patron messaging preferences will, by default, look like this:

.. TODO::Email insert image
