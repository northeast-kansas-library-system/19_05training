Email and Digests only
----------------------

For the "Item due" and "Advanced notice" messaging preferences, if staff check "Email," "Digests only" will also be checked automatically.

In the past it has been possible to check the "Digests only" checkbox without also checking the "Email" checkbox.  When "Digests only" is checked and "Email" is not, the patron will not receive any e-mail for that notice.  Because many staff don't understand this, we added code that automatically checks the "Digests only" checkbox whenever "Email" is checked.

Questions and answers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - Q: What does "Digests only" mean?

  * Q: What if "Digests only" is turned off?
  * A: In the case of the "Item due" and "Advanced notice," if a patron checks out 25 books, and "Digests only" is turned off, the patron will receive 25 separate e-mails saying those items are due - 1 e-mail for each item.

  - Q: If I can no longer control the "Digests only" checkboxes, why can I still see the "Digests only" column.
