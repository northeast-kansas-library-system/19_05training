Advanced cataloging editor
----------------------------

The advanced cataloging editor has been a part of Koha for several years now, but we have not turned it on because there is a potential that an untrained staff member could accidentally damage bibliographic records with this tool.

After the upgrade the advanced cataloging editor has been tied to a security setting so it can be turned on for specific individual staff members that have been trained in how to use it.

To access the editor, look under the "Settings" button:

Once the editor is open, you should see this interface:
