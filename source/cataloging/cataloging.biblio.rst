Changes in the edit bibliographic record interface
--------------------------------------------------

When entering a new bibliographic record, the look and layout of the 000, 100, 200, etc. tabs have changed.

Currently we see:

.. image:: images/cataloging.010.png

After the upgrade we will see:

.. image:: images/cataloging.020.png

Removal of outdated message on Fast add framework
-------------------------------------------------

In October we modified the Fast add framework so that the 000 and 008 fields were no longer required on Fast add records (ILL records).

After the upgrade the "It is no longer necessary . . ." message on the "Fast add" framework will be removed.

Currently we see:

.. image:: images/cataloging.030.png

After the upgrade we will see:

.. image:: images/cataloging.040.png
