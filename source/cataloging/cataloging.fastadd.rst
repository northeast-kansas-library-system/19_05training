Removal of outdated message on Fast add framework
---------------------------------------------------

In October we modified the Fast add framework so that the 000 and 008 fields were no longer required on Fast add records (ILL records).

After the upgrade the "It is no longer necessary . . ." message on the "Fast add" framework will be removed.

Currently we see:

After the upgrade we will see:
