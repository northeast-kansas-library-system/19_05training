Frequently asked questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Q: **Why are "MOVIE"s becoming "VIDEO?"**
* A1: The 4 "Movie" item types cover items that are Blu-ray, DVD, VHS, feature length motion pictures, television shows, short films, and other types of videorecordings.  Having an item type called "Movie" may make patrons think that the item type will limit them to feature length motion pictures.  Changing the item type from "MOVIE" to "VIDEO" more accurately reflects the items included in this item type.
* A2: Currently in an alphanumeric list of item types, "Local hold movie," "Movie," "New movie," and "Walkin movie" are seperated by other item types.  It's confusing to staff and patrons to see all of these item type descriptions in a drop-down list because all of the "Movie" item types are spread throughout the list.
* A3: The names of the "WALKIN MOVIE" item type and the "LOCAL HOLD MOVIE" item types contain library staff jargon.  It will be much easier for patrons to understand "VIDEO (No holds allowed)" and "VIDEO (Local requests only)."

- Q: **What are the benefits for staff**
- A: After the upgrade, reports (such as report 2731) can be rewritten so that staff will be able to be run a report for *all* video item types at once instead of having to run those reports one at a time.
