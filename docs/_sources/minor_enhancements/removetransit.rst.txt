In transit items and lost and missing statuses
----------------------------------------------


When an item that is "In transit" from one library to another is marked as "Missing (unable to location on shelf)" the "In transit" status will now be removed.

The current behavior is that when you change the status of an "In transit" item to "Missing (unable to location on shelf)," the item remains in transit and has the missing status added to the item.

The new behavior prevents an item from being both "Missing" and "In transit" at the same time.
